{"prompt": "Originally, There were three types of cake in the cake store: Strawberry Cream Cake, Chocolate Coconut Cake, and Red Velvet Brownie Cake. Customer number is large enough so, that no cake would be left every day when the store close. As the name suggested, each cake has two ingredients: Strawberry Cream Cake with strawberries and cream, Chocolate Coconut Cake with chocolate and coconut, and Red Velvet Brownie Cake with red velvet and brownie. Different ingredients can be compatibly mixed with each other without any issue. After the cake is made, there are often some leftover materials for each ingredient. In order to reduce waste, the store often combine the extra ingredients in pairs to make new small gifts to gain extra sales. For example, strawberries and chocolate can be mixed to create strawberry-flavored chocolate sauce, and brownies and shredded coconut can be mixed to create brownie coconut cookies. Only two ingredients can be mixed, and mixture with more than two ingredients can cost a lot of time and will not be adopted. In order to decrease the problem complexity, the store will also prevent from careful decorations or other difficult steps as in procedure of making cakes, so that time cost can be omited. By analogy, if all the ingredients can be combined in pairs, what small products can the store make in the end?"}
